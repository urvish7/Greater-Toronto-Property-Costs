This project is about the analysis of the Toronto property prices dataset. We have to do analysis on the data that is on the file. 
We will perform:
  - The Statistical analysis 
  - GTA pricing overview
  - Checking that if the data is evenly distributed
  - Taking the sample data from dataset to check wheather it is linear regression or not.
  - Visualization : 
  
      - Property prices in GTA in respect to the no of listing
      - No of listing in respect to the different regions in GTA
      - Whats the no of bedrooms looks like in respect to no of listing
      - Whats the no of bathrooms looks like in respect to no of listing
